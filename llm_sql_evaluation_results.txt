AND c.condition_concept_id = 316666
AND (YEAR(c.start_date) - p.year_of_birth) > 40;

### Explanation
- **SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.person_id): This query counts the number of unique patients who meet the specified conditions.
- **FROM PERSON p: This specifies the main table containing demographic information about the patients.
- **JOIN CONDITION c ON p.person_id = c.person_id: This joins the PERSON table with the CONDITION table to filter records based on specific condition codes.
- **WHERE p.gender_concept_id = 5532: This filters the records to include only female patients.
- **AND p.ethnicity_concept_id = 8800563: This filters the records to include only patients of Hispanic ethnicity.
- **AND c.condition_concept_id = 316666: This filters the records to include only those with a specific condition code related to anemia.
- **AND (YEAR(c.start_date) - p.year_of_birth) > 40: This condition ensures that the patient is at least 40 years old when the condition started.

### Key Points:
- The query focuses on counting the number of unique patients who meet specific demographic and condition criteria.
- It uses standard SQL JOIN statements to combine relevant tables and filter records based on specific conditions.
- The query is structured to provide clear and actionable insights into the data, focusing on key demographic and operational metrics.

### Input:
- None

### Response:
- The query returns the following information:
  - The count of unique patients who meet the specified conditions.
  - The query is structured to follow SQL best practices, ensuring clarity and accuracy in data retrieval.

### Data Used:
- Relevant clinical and demographic data from the Odoo database.

### Key Fields:
- COUNT(DISTINCT p.person_id): Counts the number of unique patients.
- p.gender_concept_id: Filters records to include only female patients.
- p.ethnicity_concept_id: Filters records to include only patients of Hispanic ethnicity.
- c.condition_concept_id: Filters records to include only
