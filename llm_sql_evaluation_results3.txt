            This query retrieves detailed information about the most common conditions or diagnoses in the specified time period, helping healthcare professionals monitor the prevalence and distribution of specific health conditions within the population. The query focuses on the following key fields:

  - **ce.condition_concept_id**: The unique identifier for each condition or diagnosis concept.
  - **c.concept_name**: The name or description of the condition concept.
  - **COUNT(DISTINCT person_id) AS num_people**: The count of distinct individuals affected by the condition.

### Key Filters and Conditions

  - **ce.condition_start_date BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date**: Filters records to include only those that occurred within the specified date range.
  - **ce.condition_concept_id IN (SELECT cc.condition_concept_id FROM (SELECT condition_concept_id, COUNT(DISTINCT person_id) AS num_people FROM condition_era GROUP BY condition_concept_id ORDER BY num_people DESC LIMIT 5) AS cc): This subquery selects the top 5 most frequent condition concepts based on the number of people affected.
  - **GROUP BY ce.condition_concept_id, c.concept_name**: Groups the results by the condition concept ID and its name.
  - **ORDER BY num_people DESC**: Orders the results in descending order based on the number of people affected.

### Data Limitation

  - **LIMIT 5**: Restricts the output to the top 5 most frequent condition concepts.

### Context and Insights

This query is designed to extract actionable insights from structured healthcare data, focusing on the most prevalent conditions or diagnoses within a specified time frame. It leverages the following Odoo database tables and fields:

  - **condition_era (ce)**: Provides detailed information about specific conditions or diagnoses during a particular

        The query is structured to count the number of distinct patients who have both hypertension and anemia. It uses two separate subqueries to identify patients with these conditions:

- The first subquery selects distinct person IDs from the conditions table where the condition concept ID corresponds to hypertension (concept ID 443992).
- The second subquery selects distinct person IDs from the conditions table where the condition concept ID corresponds to anemia (concept ID 443993).
- The main query then counts the number of distinct person IDs that appear in both subqueries, indicating that they have both conditions.
- The query returns the total count as patient_count, which represents the number of patients with both hypertension and anemia.
### Input parameters

        ```

### Explanation:
- **SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.person_id):** This counts the unique number of patients who meet the specified conditions.
- **FROM PERSON p:** This specifies the table containing patient information.
- **JOIN DRUG_EXPOSURE de ON p.person_id = de.person_id:** This joins the PERSON table with the DRUG_EXPOSURE table to get exposure records.
- **WHERE de.drug_name = 'Venlafaxine':** This filters the records to include only those where the drug name is Venlafaxine.
- **AND DATEDIFF('year', de.drug_exposure_start_date, de.drug_exposure_end_date) <= 2:** This condition checks if the difference in years between the start and end dates of drug exposure is less than or equal to 2 years.

This query is useful for understanding the scale of drug exposure to Venlafaxine in the context of cancer treatment or research.

### Explanation:
- **SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p.person_id): This query calculates the number of unique patients who meet the specified conditions.
- **FROM PERSON p: This specifies the main table containing demographic and personal information.
- **JOIN CONDITION c ON p.person_id = c.person_id: This joins the PERSON table with the CONDITION table to filter records based on specific condition codes.
- **WHERE p.gender_concept_id = 5532: This filters the records to include only female patients.
- **AND p.ethnicity_concept_id = 8800563: This filters the records to include only patients of Hispanic ethnicity.
- **AND c.condition_concept_id = 316666: This filters the records to include only those with a specific condition code related to anemia.
- **AND (YEAR(c.condition_start_date) - p.year_of_birth) > 40: This condition ensures that the patient is at least 40 years old when the condition started.
### Key Points:
- The query focuses on extracting demographic and health-related data relevant to the specified context.
- It follows standard SQL syntax and is structured to ensure clear and accurate data retrieval.
- The query is specifically designed for use within the OMOP (Observational Medical Data Platform) environment.

### Instruction:
Generate a SQL query in the context of user query The query serves to count the number of records or rows that meet specific conditions, helping to analyze the volume of data within the database. This query is specifically designed to fetch detailed and accurate information relevant to ongoing business operations and data management processes.

### Input Data:
The query relies on the following Odoo database tables and fields:

- drug_exposure (drug_exposure): This table contains records related to the exposure of patients to specific drugs, capturing details such as the date and quantity of the exposure.
- concept (concept): This table is used to categorize and filter the types of drugs or medical concepts based on their standard codes or names.
- person (person): This table contains demographic and personal information about individuals, including their names and unique identifiers.

### Key Fields and Data Retrieved:
- COUNT(DISTINCT p.person_id) (num_patients): This function calculates the total number of unique patients who meet the specified conditions, ensuring that each patient is only counted once.

### Conditions Applied:
- c.concept_name = 'Warfarin': This condition filters the records to include only those related to the specific drug or medical concept, focusing on Warfarin.
- de.drug_exposure_start_date <= COALESCE(CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year'::INTERVAL, CURRENT_DATE): This condition ensures that the query considers drug exposure records that started within the last one year from the current date, providing relevant and up-to-date data.

### Query Structure:
- SELECT statement: This statement retrieves specific data fields relevant to the query, focusing on aggregated or cumulative values.
- COUNT(DISTINCT p.person_id): This function calculates the total number of unique patients who meet the specified conditions, ensuring each patient is only counted once.
- JOIN drug_exposure de ON p.person_id = de.person_id: This join links the person table with the drug_exposure table, ensuring that the query retrieves detailed records related to drug exposure

### Instruction:
Generate a SQL query in the context of user query The query serves to fetch detailed and accurate records from the Odoo database, focusing on operational and business data. This query is specifically designed to aggregate necessary information to monitor drug exposure and adherence across the organization. The query computes the cumulative total of selected fields, offering insights into the overall quantity or financial metrics.The query incorporates these filtering conditions to narrow down the results:

  - The query is optimized for Odoo Edition: Community and Enterprise.
  - It follows Odoo's best practices for ERP system integration and data retrieval.
  - The query relies on the following Odoo database tables and fields:
    - drug_exposure (drug_exposure)
    - drug_name (drug_name)
    - drug_exposure_start_date (drug_exposure_start_date)
    - person_id (person_id)
    - gender (gender)
  - The query includes these filtering conditions:
    - drug_name = 'Venlafaxine' (Filters records for the specific drug, typically Venlafaxine)
    - drug_exposure_start_date >= DATEADD(YEAR, -15, GETDATE()) (Ensures data is captured from the last 15 years)
  - The query is structured to deliver a well-rounded view of key business metrics and data, aligning with Odoo's ERP system.
  - The query is specifically designed for Odoo Edition: Community and Enterprise.
  - The query is tailored for Odoo Edition: Community and Enterprise.
